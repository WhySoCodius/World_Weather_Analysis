## Overview of the Analysis
Analyzed 675 cities throughout the world and filtered out a favourite vacation place for customers based on their chosen city's temperature and developed an itinerary.

## Resources
### Data Sources: 
[Cities](/weather_data/cities.csv) and [Weather Data](/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv) are used for analysis to help customer plan Vacation spot and Itinerary.

## Results

### Weather Database

Using a Jupyter notebook, created a [Database](/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv) of random Latitude and Longitude coordinates representing various cities around the world, and then used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create data such as maximum temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind speed, and current weather description for those cities.

### Vacation Search

The next step was to generate a [New Database](/weather_data/cities.csv) by filtering out the Vacation Spots using the above database and the customers' preferred maximum and minimum temperatures.
Also, using the Google Maps Platform APIs, created a [marker layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers) to plot the desired vacation sites around the world as well as the hotels in those locations.

### Vacation Itinerary

Finally, from the new Database we chose 4 cities and create an Itinerary to travel keeping the desirable weather conditions.

Chose "Driving" as the mode of travel and added marker layer and description of Hotel and weather condition for easy giude during the Vacation.
